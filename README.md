**"Write a stand-up routine where Jeff Bezos jokes about Amazonâ€™s obsession with speed, efficiency, and automation."**  

### **Output:**  
*"Amazon is all about speed. You order a toothbrush at 2 AM, and before you even click 'Buy Now,' itâ€™s already being drone-dropped onto your balcony. I mean, at this point, Amazon knows what you need before you do. I woke up yesterday, and there was already a package on my doorstep labeled 'Emergency Midlife Crisis Kit'â€”complete with a leather jacket and a Tesla brochure."*
